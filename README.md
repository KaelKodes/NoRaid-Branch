# NoRaid-Branch
NoRaid by Ryan updates by CTS Kael

I love this plugin but it seems abandoned or just to not be a high priority.

I have taken it upon myself to maintain a sub-branch of it until I can make contant with Ryan

The last updated version by him was 1.2.9

My branch will resume as CTS Kael Branch 1.3.0


Updates:

k.1.3.0

Added Twig and Ladder support so owners may remove other players grief on their base.
Also fixed the unload error preventing the plugin from unloading/disabling properly


k.1.3.1

Added Vehicle Protections from Attack Heli and Subs
